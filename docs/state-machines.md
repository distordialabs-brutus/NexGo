## 1. App Initialization

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> CreatingStore : App mounts
    CreatingStore --> HydratingState : configureStore()
    HydratingState --> RequestingGeolocation : Main useEffect()
    RequestingGeolocation --> GPSAcquired : navigator.geolocation\nsuccess
    RequestingGeolocation --> FallingBackToIP : navigator.geolocation\nerror / denied / timeout
    FallingBackToIP --> IPAcquired : ipapi.co success

    GPSAcquired --> Ready : setUserPosition() +\nfetchTaxis()
    IPAcquired --> Ready : setUserPosition() +\nfetchTaxis()
    NoLocation --> Ready : fetchTaxis()\n(no position)

    Ready --> [*]

    note right of CreatingStore
        Redux store with thunk,

## 2. Tab Navigation

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> Passenger : default activeTab

    Passenger --> Driver : switchTab('Driver')
    Driver --> Passenger : switchTab('Passenger')

    state Passenger {
        [*] --> PassengerView
        note right of PassengerView
            Taxi list + Map + Address search
            Auto-refresh taxis every 10s

            Vehicle form + Broadcasting +
            Asset management
        end note
    }
```

## 3. Taxi Fetching

Shared sub-flow used by the Passenger tab (initial mount, auto-refresh every 10s, and manual refresh).

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> Idle

    Idle --> Loading : fetchTaxis()\n[mount / 10s interval / refresh btn]
    Loading --> Loaded : FETCH_TAXIS_SUCCESS\n(taxis array updated)
    Loading --> Error : FETCH_TAXIS_ERROR\n(error message stored)

    Loaded --> Loading : fetchTaxis()\n[10s interval / refresh btn]
    Error --> Loading : fetchTaxis()\n[10s interval / refresh btn]

    note right of Loading
        API: register/list/assets:asset
        Filter: distordia-type=nexgo-taxi
                AND status != offline
        Limit: 100
    end note

    note right of Loaded
        state.taxi.taxis = [{
          id, vehicleId, type,
          serviceType,
          status, lat, lng,
          driver, lastUpdate
        }, ...]
    end note
```

## 4. Passenger Flow

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> LoadingPassengerData : Tab active
    LoadingPassengerData : fetchRatings()
    LoadingPassengerData : loadMyRatings()
    LoadingPassengerData : listMyRideRequests()
    LoadingPassengerData : invoices/list/outstanding
    LoadingPassengerData --> Idle

    state Idle {
        [*] --> ViewingTaxiList
        ViewingTaxiList : Taxi list sorted by distance
        ViewingTaxiList : Map shows taxi markers
        ViewingTaxiList : Auto-refresh every 10s
        ViewingTaxiList : Ratings shown per taxi owner
    }

    Idle --> SearchingDestination : User types in\naddress field

    state SearchingDestination {
        [*] --> Querying
        Querying : Nominatim API geocode request
        Querying --> ShowingSuggestions : Results returned
        ShowingSuggestions --> Querying : User types more
    }

    SearchingDestination --> Idle : User clears input
    SearchingDestination --> DestinationSelected : User picks\nan address

    state DestinationSelected {
        [*] --> ViewingRoute
        ViewingRoute : Route drawn on map\n(Leaflet Routing Machine)
        ViewingRoute : Distance shown in km
        ViewingRoute : Taxi list still visible
    }

    DestinationSelected --> CreatingRideRequest : Click Hire / Hire Auto\n[pickup + destination + taxi available]

    state CreatingRideRequest {
        [*] --> SubmittingRide
        SubmittingRide : API: assets/create/asset\nformat=raw
        SubmittingRide : name = nexgo-ride-{timestamp}
        SubmittingRide : data.distordia-type = nexgo-ride
    }

    CreatingRideRequest --> DestinationSelected : Success\nshowSuccessDialog()
    CreatingRideRequest --> DestinationSelected : Error\nshowErrorDialog()

    DestinationSelected --> PayingInvoice : Passenger sees\noutstanding ride invoice

    state PayingInvoice {
        [*] --> Paying
        Paying : API: invoices/pay/invoice
        Paying --> UnsafeProjection : fulfilled result OR PIN cancellation\n(current code does not validate response)
        UnsafeProjection : API: assets/update/asset\nformat=raw status=paid
        UnsafeProjection : no persisted payment txid,\nreadback, or recovery state
    }

    PayingInvoice --> DestinationSelected : UI reports success if both calls resolve
    PayingInvoice --> DestinationSelected : Error\nshowErrorDialog()

    DestinationSelected --> SearchingDestination : User changes\ndestination
    DestinationSelected --> Idle : User clears\ndestination
```

## 5. Driver Asset Management

This flow is for human-operated taxis created inside the module. Autonomous taxis can skip the UI and create/update the same `nexgo-taxi` asset standard directly via the Nexus API.

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> CheckingAsset : Driver tab mounts

    CheckingAsset --> NoAsset : listMyTaxiAssets()\nreturns empty
    CheckingAsset --> AssetReady : listMyTaxiAssets()\nreturns asset → SET_DRIVER_ASSET

    state NoAsset {
        [*] --> EditingForm
        EditingForm : Enter Vehicle ID
        EditingForm : Select Vehicle Type
        EditingForm : Select Status (available/occupied)
        EditingForm : service-type = human
    }

    NoAsset --> CreatingAsset : Click "Create Taxi Asset"\n[vehicleId not empty]

    state CreatingAsset {
        [*] --> Pending
        Pending : ASSET_OPERATION_START
        Pending : API: assets/create/asset
        Pending : format=JSON
        Pending : fields include\nservice-type, driver, timestamp
        Pending --> Verifying : Asset created
        Verifying : API: assets/get/asset
        Verifying : Fetch back the new asset
    }

    CreatingAsset --> AssetReady : SET_DRIVER_ASSET +\nASSET_OPERATION_SUCCESS
    CreatingAsset --> NoAsset : Error →\nshowErrorDialog()

    state AssetReady {
        [*] --> AssetIdle
        AssetIdle : Shows asset info card
        AssetIdle : (name, type, status, address)
        AssetIdle : Form fields editable
    }

    AssetReady --> UpdatingAsset : Click "Update Asset On-Chain"

    state UpdatingAsset {
        [*] --> Saving
        Saving : ASSET_OPERATION_START
        Saving : API: assets/update/asset
    }

    UpdatingAsset --> AssetReady : ASSET_OPERATION_SUCCESS\n→ showSuccessDialog()
    UpdatingAsset --> AssetReady : Error →\nshowErrorDialog()
```

## 6. Driver Broadcasting

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> Idle : Broadcasting = false

    state Idle {
        [*] --> Ready
        Ready : Form editable
        Ready : No GPS watch active
        Ready : No position updates sent
    }

    Idle --> StartingBroadcast : Click "Start Broadcasting"\n[vehicleId not empty, GPS available]

    state StartingBroadcast {
        [*] --> ValidateState
        ValidateState --> Blocked : No vehicleId / no position / no asset
        ValidateState --> PushInitialUpdate : Ready to publish
        PushInitialUpdate : API: assets/update/asset\n(status, lat, lng, timestamp)
        PushInitialUpdate --> ActivateBroadcast : Update succeeded
        ActivateBroadcast : setBroadcasting(true)
    }

    StartingBroadcast --> Idle : Error\nshowErrorDialog()
    StartingBroadcast --> Broadcasting : Broadcasting activated

    state Broadcasting {
        [*] --> Active
        Active : GPS watchPosition() running\n(high accuracy)
        Active : Redux userPosition updated locally
        Active : Form fields disabled

        state Active {
            [*] --> WaitingForManualPush
            WaitingForManualPush --> SendingUpdate : Click "Update Location On-Chain"
            SendingUpdate : API: assets/update/asset\n(lat, lng, status, vehicle-type, timestamp)
            SendingUpdate --> WaitingForManualPush : Success / Error dialog
        }
    }

    Broadcasting --> StatusChange : Toggle Available / Occupied
    StatusChange --> Broadcasting : setDriverStatus()\n(next on-chain push uses new status)

    Broadcasting --> StoppingBroadcast : Click "Stop Broadcasting"

    state StoppingBroadcast {
        [*] --> Deactivating
        Deactivating : setBroadcasting(false)
        Deactivating : Clear GPS watch
        Deactivating --> SettingOffline : Update asset\nstatus = 'offline'
        SettingOffline : API: assets/update/asset
    }

    StoppingBroadcast --> Idle : Done\n(silent error handling)

    state Blocked {
        [*] --> WaitingForInput
    }
```

## 7. Settlement: observed unsafe flow and required executable contract

The current UI is not a settlement state machine. It correlates by description text, sends the stale invoice destination key `account`, discards nested invoice terms, retains no issue/payment identity, and performs projections after any fulfilled mutation promise—including `undefined` returned when the wallet PIN prompt is cancelled.

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> RideRequested
    RideRequested --> IssueCall : Driver clicks issue
    IssueCall --> TaxiProjection : promise fulfilled, including undefined
    IssueCall --> ErrorDialog : promise rejected
    TaxiProjection --> SuccessDialog : taxi update resolves
    TaxiProjection --> ErrorDialog : taxi update rejects\ninvoice outcome not retained

    RideRequested --> PaymentCall : Passenger sees correlated outstanding item
    PaymentCall --> RidePaidProjection : promise fulfilled, including undefined
    PaymentCall --> ErrorDialog : promise rejected
    RidePaidProjection --> SuccessDialog : ride update resolves
    RidePaidProjection --> ErrorDialog : ride update rejects\npayment outcome not retained
```

The replacement must implement the following durable protocol. This is the acceptance target, not current behavior:

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> IntentPersisted
    IntentPersisted --> AuthorizationCancelled : PIN cancelled\nno submission or projection
    IntentPersisted --> Submitted : wallet submits once
    Submitted --> IdentityKnown : strict address/txid result
    Submitted --> SubmissionUnknown : timeout, malformed/empty result, interruption
    IdentityKnown --> EvidenceVerified : exact invoice + creation/payment tx readback
    IdentityKnown --> Held : evidence missing/conflicting
    SubmissionUnknown --> EvidenceVerified : exact recovery finds matching evidence
    SubmissionUnknown --> Held : absence cannot be proven safely
    EvidenceVerified --> ProjectionPending
    ProjectionPending --> Complete : exact idempotent projection readback
    ProjectionPending --> ProjectionPending : restart/retry projection only
    AuthorizationCancelled --> [*]
    Held --> [*]
    Complete --> [*]
```

Issuer verification binds the exact invoice address to its retained creation transaction and provider genesis. Current invoice owner is lifecycle evidence: outstanding is system-owned and paid is recipient-owned. Payment verification compares nested terms and actual DEBIT/CLAIM evidence in bounded exact base units. Description `ride=...` is discovery-only. Neither an empty outstanding list nor a projection status proves issue/payment absence or success.
