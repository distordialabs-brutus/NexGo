# NexGo

**Decentralized taxi hiring service built on the Nexus blockchain.**

**Engineering status:** prototype, not payment-release-ready. See the [architecture](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md), [development plan](docs/DEVELOPMENT_PLAN.md), and [2026-09-08 review](docs/DEVELOPMENT_REVIEW_2026-09-08.md) for core invoice compatibility, settlement evidence and production packaging gates.

NexGo is a Nexus Wallet module that lets drivers register their vehicles on-chain and broadcast their GPS positions in real-time. Passengers can discover nearby available taxis, see them on a live map, and search for destinations — all without a centralized server.

The same on-chain taxi standard can also be published directly by external providers using the Nexus API, which allows autonomous / self-driving taxi fleets to appear in the passenger module alongside human drivers.

## How it works

NexGo has two modes, accessible via tabs inside the module:

### 🚕 Passenger mode

- **Find taxis** — The passenger view automatically queries the Nexus blockchain for all active taxi assets and displays them on an interactive map.
- **Search destinations** — Type an address into the search bar (powered by OpenStreetMap/Nominatim) to set your destination and see routing on the map.
- **Distance sorting** — Available taxis are listed by distance from your current GPS position, with estimated travel times.
- **Hire on-chain** — Once pickup and destination are set, the passenger can create a decentralized `nexgo-ride` request asset for a selected taxi, including autonomous taxis.
- **Settle accepted rides** — The passenger can review outstanding ride invoices and pay them directly through the Nexus Invoices API from the module.
- **Reputation layer** — Drivers and autonomous providers can be rated on-chain through the `nexgo-rating` raw asset standard.
- The taxi list refreshes every 10 seconds.

### 🚗 Driver mode

- **Register your vehicle** — Enter your Vehicle ID / license plate and select your vehicle type (sedan, SUV, van, or luxury).
- **Create a Taxi Asset** — Click "Create Taxi Asset" to write your vehicle to the Nexus blockchain as an on-chain asset. This costs 2 NXS (1 for the asset register + 1 for the name). You will be prompted for your PIN.
- **Broadcast your position** — Click "Start Broadcasting" to publish your current status/location on-chain once and enable local GPS tracking in the module.
- **Manual on-chain pushes** — While broadcasting is active, use "Update Location On-Chain" whenever you want to write the latest tracked coordinates to the blockchain.
- **Set your status** — Toggle between **Available** and **Occupied** to let passengers know whether you can accept rides.
- **Update your asset** — Manually push your current status and location to the blockchain at any time via "Update Asset On-Chain".
- **Stop broadcasting** — Click "Stop Broadcasting" to set your on-chain status to offline and stop position updates.
- **Accept requests with invoices** — Review incoming `nexgo-ride` requests, create an invoice for a selected request, and cancel unpaid invoices if needed.

### 🤖 Autonomous / self-driving providers

Autonomous fleets do not need to use the Driver tab. They can register compatible `nexgo-taxi-*` assets directly with the Nexus Assets API, keep them updated through their own agents, and receive passenger hire requests through the same decentralized standards consumed by this module.

### On-chain data

Each taxi is stored as a Nexus `asset` register using the JSON format with the following fields:

| Field | Type | Mutable | Description |
|-------|------|---------|-------------|
| `distordia-type` | string | No | Always `nexgo-taxi` — used to identify and filter taxi assets |
| `service-type` | string | No | `human` for module-created taxis, `autonomous` for self-driving providers |
| `vehicle-id` | string | Yes | Driver's vehicle ID or license plate |
| `vehicle-type` | string | Yes | `sedan`, `suv`, `van`, or `luxury` |
| `status` | string | Yes | `available`, `occupied`, or `offline` |
| `latitude` | string | Yes | Current GPS latitude |
| `longitude` | string | Yes | Current GPS longitude |
| `driver` | string | Yes | Provider / operator genesis identifier |
| `timestamp` | string | Yes | ISO 8601 timestamp of last update |

Assets are queried network-wide using `register/list/assets:asset` with a WHERE clause filtering on `distordia-type=nexgo-taxi`.

Passenger hire requests are stored as raw assets using the `nexgo-ride` standard. Ratings are stored as raw assets using the `nexgo-rating` standard.

Ride acceptance is represented by invoice issuance: because ride requests remain owned by the passenger's signature chain, the provider accepts by creating an invoice that references the ride, and the passenger updates the ride asset after payment.

## Prerequisites

- [Nexus Wallet](https://github.com/Nexusoft/NexusInterface/releases/latest) v3.1.5 or later
- A Nexus user account (profile) — you must be logged in to the wallet
- At least 2 NXS in your account to create a taxi asset
- GPS / location services enabled in your browser

---

## Installation

### From a release

1. Download the latest NexGo `.zip` from the releases page.
2. Open Nexus Wallet → **Settings** → **Modules**.
3. Drag and drop the `.zip` file into the "Add module" section and click **Install module**.
4. The wallet will refresh and a **NexGo** item will appear in the bottom navigation bar.

### From source (development)

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/AkstonCap/NexGo.git
cd NexGo

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the dev server (with hot reload)
npm run dev

# Or build for production
npm run build
```

When developing, use `nxs_package.dev.json` to point the wallet at your local dev server. See the [Nexus Module Development docs](Nexus%20API%20docs/Modules/README.md) for details.

## Usage walkthrough

### As a driver

1. Open NexGo in the wallet and switch to the **Driver** tab.
2. Enter your **Vehicle ID** (e.g. your license plate) and choose a **Vehicle Type**.
3. Click **Create Taxi Asset** — you will be prompted for your wallet PIN. This registers your vehicle on the blockchain.
4. Set your status to **Available**.
5. Click **Start Broadcasting** — your current status and location will be published on-chain, and local GPS tracking will begin inside the module.
6. Use **Update Location On-Chain** whenever you want to publish your latest tracked location.
7. When you're done for the day, click **Stop Broadcasting**. Your on-chain status will be set to offline.

### As a passenger

1. Open NexGo in the wallet and stay on the **Passenger** tab.
2. Allow location access so NexGo can show taxis near you.
3. Available taxis appear on the map and in a sorted list below it.
4. Use the search bar to enter a destination and see a route on the map.
5. Click **Hire** / **Hire Auto** to create an on-chain ride request for the selected taxi.
6. If the provider accepts, an outstanding invoice appears in the payment section.
7. Pay the invoice from your configured passenger payment account.
8. Click **Refresh** to manually update the taxi list, or wait for the 10-second auto-refresh.

### As an autonomous provider

1. Create a `nexgo-taxi-{vehicleId}` asset directly with `assets/create/asset` using the `JSON` format and the same field names listed above.
2. Set `service-type=autonomous` and keep `status`, `latitude`, `longitude`, and `timestamp` updated via `assets/update/asset`.
3. Monitor passenger-created `nexgo-ride-*` raw assets through `register/list/assets:raw`.
4. Accept jobs by creating invoices that reference the ride asset, and settle payments with the Nexus Invoices API.
